				<div id="header2"><p>What is secondary storage?</p></div>

				<div id="bodyText">
					<p>Secondary storage, in terms of computing, refers to a non-volatile storage device on a computer. Non-volatile means that it is a storage device that enables permanent storage; data isn't lost after power is lost.</p>

					<p>RAM (see chapter 1.2), ROM (see chapter 1.2) and CPU cache (see chapter 1.1) is counted as primary storage. Other storage devices, such as the hard drive in a computer, or a USB flash drive, is counted as secondary storage. Secondary storage is basically a semi-permanent storage of data that can change, and stores programs and files when the power is turned off.</p>

					Tertiary storage is a storage medium that is for archival purposes. An example would be a tape format, where data is dumped onto this storage format, and stored away for backup purposes.</i></p>

				<div id="header2"><p>Data capacity</p></div>

				<div id="bodyText">
					<p>When refering to the capacity of a storage medium, it is referring to how much data it can hold. This is measured in bits.</p>

					<p>A bit is the smallest unit of data in a computer system. A bit is a single binary value, represented by either a 0 or a 1. You can put a bits together, to make larger units of data, such as nibbles and bytes.</p>

					<p>Bits can be converted into different capacities, as shown below:</p>

					<ul>
						
						<li>4 bits in a nibble</li>
						<li>8 bits (2 nibbles) in a byte</li>
						<li>1000 bytes in a kilobyte</li>
						<li>1000 kilobytes in a megabyte</li>
						<li>1000 megabytes in a gigabyte</li>
						<li>1000 gigabytes in a terabyte</li>

					</ul>

					<p>In the past, 1024 would be used in place of the 1000 conversion measurement. However, for OCR, unless explicitly stated to use 1024, use 1000.</p>

					<p><img src="exclaim.png" /><strong><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond GCSE Information</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;~&nbsp;&nbsp;

					In fact, in modern computing, a kibibyte/mebibyte/gibibyte/tebibyte is the terminology for the 1024 conversion measurement. So, a kilobyte is 1000 bytes, whilst a kibibyte is 1024 bytes, and so on.</i></p>

					<p>Conversion between different measurements in the computing exam will most certainly show up. To be able to go from a bit, to a terabyte, you do 8*1000*1000*1000*1000, or 8*1000^4. A recommendation is to write out each of the steps, going from a bit to a terabyte, and then following each step until you get the correct answer.</p>

				<div id="header2"><p>Data types</p></div>

				<div id="bodyText">
					<p>In terms of file sizes, you won't have to know specific file sizes for any data type. However, you will need to know how large files are, in relation to one-another. The list below (from lowest size to highest) is the general size of different file types:</p>

					<uL>
						<li>Word Documents (Smallest)</li>
						<li>Image files</li>
						<li>Sound files</li>
						<li>Video files (Largest)</li>
					</uL>

					<p>Of course, compression will play a factor in file size. You can read more about this in chapter 2.6.</p>
