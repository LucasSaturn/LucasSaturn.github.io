				<div id="header2"><p>What is a computer network?</p></div>

				<div id="bodyText">
					<p>A computer network is a group of (2 or more) computer systems that are <i>linked together</i>. The main issue that comes up in networking is how the computer network is set up; the way they are linked is a large issue. We connect computer systems to networks so we can share access to files and external devices (such as printers).</p>

				<div id="header2"><p>LAN vs WAN</p></div>

				<div id="bodyText">
					<p>A Local Area Network is a group of computers that are connected together <i>over a small geographical area such as a single building or single site</i>. This includes, but is not limited to, home networks, school networks or a network in a shop. </p>

					<p>A Wide Area Network is a group of computer that are connected together <i>over a large geographical area such as town-wide or country-wide</i>. The biggest WAN would be a global collection of networks, also known as the internet. </p>

					<p>LAN has its own infrastructure of cabling and network hardware. This is due to distance and practicalities of the network. WAN, on the other hand, uses external hardware and external infrastrucutre, such as the use of satellite, phone lines or the internet.</p>



					<p>Dedicated lines are created and maintained by the company, unlike leased lines which are rented from an ISP. Dedicated lines are much more expensive, as they are not rented. However, up-time is prioritised on dedicated lines, for the fact that they are created specifically for the company.</p>

				<div id="header2"><p>Client-Server vs Peer-to-Peer</p></div>

				<div id="bodyText">
					<p>Peer-to-Peer networks have no central servers. Each workstation shares its files equally with others. Client-Server, on the other hand, has a dedicated server and clients. The server determines which users can access each file on the network.</p>

					<p> Peer-to-Peer networks are usually used in homes or in small businesses. They are inexpensive, but offer almost no security. Along with this, they must be setup individually. Client-Server networks can become as big as you need them to be, and thus are much more expensive. </p>
