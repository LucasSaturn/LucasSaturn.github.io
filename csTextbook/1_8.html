				<div id="header2"><p>The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) 2000</p></div>

				<div id="bodyText">
					<p>This demands that an ISP provide access to the customer's communications in secret to the police. Allow mass surveillance of communications in transit, and effectively allows the public bodies to access information being accessed by the users of an ISP. </p>

					<p>This act also makes it illegal for those not under the act, to surveillance others without express permission from the government. There is a concern as to the range of public bodies who are allowed to access such information.</p>

					<p>This act has come under scrutiny for being a breach of privacy. It has been claimed that local councils are conducting over a thousand RIPA-based covert surveillance operations every month for petty offences. April 2008; a council officials in Dorset put a family under surveillance to simply check whether they lived in a particular school catchment area. Another example would include the same council putting fishermen under covert surveillance to check for illegal harvesting of clams.</p>
